        <h3>What You Need</h3>
        <p>The class is designed for anyone with little to no knowledge of coding. No prerequisite knowledge is required. Unlike other courses, you won't need to install anything on your computer either: All you need is a desktop, internet, and an hour of time.

            To avoid installation, we use a website called pytwiddle.com -- it's free, doesn't require an account to use, and allows you to share code easily (by clicking on the "Share" button).
        </p>
